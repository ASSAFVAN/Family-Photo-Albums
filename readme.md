This project has both back-end and front-end. 

The frontend made with React Hooks, JavaScript and plain CSS (wanted to practice more on pure css rathar than using libraries).
Back-end is based on mongoDB using mongoose library, with NodeJS and Express.

The project is Family-Photo-Albums where you can login and create/view/edit 
photo albums.
I've created REST API and implemented full authintication using JWT package to generate a new token for users and bcriptjs for hashing the password before saving it to the DB.
I've also used Multer middleware for uploading photos and Cloudinary for saving the photos.
